    Due to ever-increasing demand, we are looking for more rental units to offer our
    substantial client base.

    If you own a fully furnished property in the Victoria area we have guests looking
    to rent for short term, mid term and even longer terms of six months or less.

    We cater to Corporate Stays, Executive Rentals, Emergency Housing (Insurance claims,)
    Vacation Rentals and Longer Term Visits. We attract clients looking to move to
    Vancouver Island who want to rent for a few months while they look for their forever
    home.

    With our extensive network of advertising and referrals we find clients worldwide
    who will pay premium prices for short term stays or just great holidays of a week
    or more.

    We manage all your property expenses for you, ensure maintenance is always done
    and keep your place ship shape. We handle all guest interaction, cleaning between
    guests and ongoing maid service during stays.

    Best of all, we charge a percentage of rentals, no rentals, no charges.

    You pay nothing if your property is not rented.

    We provide detailed monthly income and service reports, prompt payments and reviews
    to maximize your property''s potential.

    If you wish to visit your property for a week or so, simply give us appropriate
    notice and we will block off time for you to also enjoy your own property.

    With over 40 years property management experience, our professional team will
    provide you with peace of mind and great income also.

    Call Don now at 778 244 7840 to discuss how we can make your vacant property generate
    above average revenue for you.


    PS: If your property is not fully furnished we have furnishing packages available
    to make your empty house or condo into a palace.

    rental suite and we are looking for a bit more space to grow.  Ideally would be
    looking for something with 3 bedrooms that is sound proof from other tenants.  Just
    looking for a nice place where we can raise our daughter in peace and live happily.  Preferred
    location would be in Esquimalt, View Royal, or Tillicum neighborhood, but not
    entirely limited to any area.  Please contact me if you feel we would be a good
